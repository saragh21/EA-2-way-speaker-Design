1. Introduction (0-0.5)p

This report presents the design, implementation and measurements of group 5â€™s loudspeaker. The objective of this project was to build a studio monitor with a flat frequency response, smooth directivity and a good bass response. This report discusses the design choices made during the project, proposes a passive crossover network with similar characteristics  to the digital filter used and discusses potential improvements and the next steps towards a better prototype.

3. Equivalent circuit of implementation 0-2p
  - Present the equivalent circuit of your design
  - Analyse the circuit and estimate the low frequency behaviour
  - Explain what you learned from the circuit
  - Does the model correlate with measurements?
4. Low frequency extension 0-2p
  - What affects the low frequency extension and what you did in
  your design?
5. Linear distortion 0-2p
  - Tell about the linear distortion behaviour of your loudspeaker.
  - What you did and why to obtain the performance?
6. Directivity 0-2p
  - Tell what affects the directivity behaviour and what have you done
  in your design
7. Passive cross-over network 0-2p
  -  Present a LCR crossover circuit that would utilize the same filter
  characteristics as the digital filter that you have used.
     Also circuit drawn if you used additional digital filtering
8. Future work 0-2p
  -  Tell what would be the next steps towards a next prototype, better
  design or even a real product? What would you change, try and
  do?
9. Conclusions 0-0.5p
