1. Introduction (0-0.5)p
  Tell shortly what was done and what is the report about
2. Equivalent circuit of implementation 0-2p
  • Present the equivalent circuit of your design
  • Analyse the circuit and estimate the low frequency behaviour
  • Explain what you learned from the circuit
  • Does the model correlate with measurements?
3. Low frequency extension 0-2p
  • What affects the low frequency extension and what you did in
  your design?
4. Linear distortion 0-2p
  • Tell about the linear distortion behaviour of your loudspeaker.
  What you did and why to obtain the performance?
5. Directivity 0-2p
  • Tell what affects the directivity behaviour and what have you done
  in your design
6. Passive cross-over network 0-2p
  • Present a LCR crossover circuit that would utilize the same filter
  characteristics as the digital filter that you have used.
  • Also circuit drawn if you used additional digital filtering
7. Future work 0-2p
  • Tell what would be the next steps towards a next prototype, better
  design or even a real product? What would you change, try and
  do?
